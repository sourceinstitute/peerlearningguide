# About The Peer Learning Guide

When a new discipline is still emerging, how do you educate people in that subject?  There are no established experts, no books,  and no agreement in best practices, so where do you begin?

We got interested in this topic when wanted to help in fast-changing contexts like humanitarian problems, the food supply chain, energy distribution, machine learning, blockchain.

The Peer Learning Guide is written for educators, program managers, and most importantly, for participants who want to improve their own education experiences.

It covers our role models' stories, like Harvard and Y Combinator in the US, MEST in Ghana, FarmHack in the Netherlands and Pirate Summit in Germany. And we share how we took what we learned from them to create some world-class education programs and globally-known communities of practice like The Sources, The Africa Prize For Engineering and the Lean Startup movement.

# About The Peer Learning Guide

When a new discipline is still emerging, how do you educate people in that subject?  There are no established experts, no books,  and no agreement in best practices, so where do you begin?

We got interested in this topic when wanted to help in fast-changing contexts like humanitarian problems, the food supply chain, energy distribution, machine learning, blockchain.

The Peer Learning Guide is written for educators, program managers, and most importantly, for participants who want to improve their own education experiences.

It covers our role models' stories, like Harvard and Y Combinator, and how we took what we learned from them to create some world-class education programs and globally-known communities of practice.

We wrote this book with action in mind.  It weaves together lots of different experiences and lessons from around the world, and gives you a set of tools to evolve education programs towards being more connected and more responsive.  

* How to design a program that will have an over-subscribed pipeline of applicants
* How to design a schedule that engages people consistently
* Why standard programs fail to align to the learners' motivations
* How to run a program that makes the learner actively pull new content, rather than passively (or sleepily) consume
* How to find more inspiring and relevant expertise, beyond the workshop/consultant brigade
* How to separate the role of the educator from the role of the domain expert
* How to remove the logistics and admin-heavy aspects of education, to free your time for high-impact activities

If you want to improve an existing educational program, build a community of practice or take your education into your own hands - this guide will help you.

Your time is priceless - the guide will help make it count.

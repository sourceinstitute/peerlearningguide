### About Source

Source Institute designs education for fast-changing environments. We are active at the frontier of new technology, and social impact, ranging from engineering ventures on the African continent, to connecting science fiction writers with government, and corporations on the topic of climate change, to finding a foothold for technology in agriculture. Source is powered by learnings from those who traverse these frontiers, and opens up their wisdom as it unfolds to the peers who follow similar destinations.
